### typescript-weather-app

Revisiting the final hackathon at SoC, a typescript weather app. Typescript is something I need to practice and I remember at the time not fully understanding what was happening, hence me having another shot at it now.

I have now made this into multiple projects that I can showcase using React and Typescript.
As I have not yet styled any pages or projects I am going to use bootstrap throughout to learn more about this technology

# Todo List

Everyone's favourite....the todo list!!! I will create a fairly simple todo list, it may have a couple of extras I'll see how I get on. However this will be the first typescript project I do from scratch with no help, tutorials, school of code hackathon's etc.
I will also use bootstrap on this application as I have it installed and I'd like to give that a good research whilst I'm doing the project.

# Original Weather App!

I learnt in this project about functions with event handlers have to have types, usually () => void seems to do the trick. Also (although I did not implement this in the end) that you can have a seperate file just for types and then import them as you would a component. I could see this being handy for large scale applications to keep things neat and tidy.
I have also added my component tree diagram to this projects folder.

# Shopping Cart Youtube tutorial

For this project along with typescript I am also using bootstrap for the CSS. This tutorial also went through larger folder structures including for data and hooks.

So now this project is finished I believe I have mainly learnt a lot about bootstrap, I've always personnaly liked custom CSS, but can really see the benifit of using something like bootstrap, it was quite fun and easy to use out the box. On the typescript side I've certainly learnt more about the props types, that's pretty much cemented now and new things like useContext makes it so I dont have to pass props down all the time, I believe its called drilling. All in all a great tutorial.
